    title: Download ERA5-Land data
    description: |
      Dowload data from the ERA5-Land dataset, which is available for 
      public use for the period from 1950 to 5 days before the current 
      date. ERA5-Land provides hourly high resolution information of 
      surface variables. The data is a replay of the land component of 
      the ERA5 climate reanalysis with a finer spatial resolution: ~9km
      grid spacing. ERA5-Land includes information about uncertainties 
      for all variables at reduced spatial and temporal resolutions.
    version: 0.1

      variables:

          The variables to download data for. This can be a single 
          variable, or multiple. See the Copernicus Climate Data Store 
          website for available variables.
          Give multiple variables whitespace delimeted, eg.
          `2m_temperature 2m_dewpoint_temperature`.
      temporal_resolution:
        type: enum
        values:
          - hourly
          - monthly

          Execute the data fetch process for hourly or monthly data.
      startyear:
        type: integer
        min: 1950
        max: 2023
        optional: true
        description: |
          Single year or first year of range for which data should be 
          downloaded.
          Every year will be downloaded in a separate file by default. 
          Set `split=false` to change this.
      endyear:
        type: integer
        min: 1950
        max: 2023
        optional: true
        description: |
          Last year of range for which data should be downloaded.
          If only a single year is needed, only `startyear` needs to 
          be specified.
          Every year will be downloaded in a separate file by default. 
          Set `split=false` to change this.
      area:
        type: string
        optional: true
        description: |
          Coordinates in case extraction of a subregion is requested.
          Specified as `LAT_MAX LON_MIN LAT_MIN LON_MAX` (counterclockwise
          coordinates, starting at the top) with longitude in the range 
          -180, +180 and latitude in the range -90, +90. For example:
          `--area 90 -180 -90 180`. Requests are rounded down
          to two decimals. By default, the entire available area will
          be returned.
